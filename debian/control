Description: libraries for CPU and heap analysis, plus an efficient thread-caching malloc
 The gperftools, previously called google-perftools, package contains some
 utilities to improve and analyze the performance of C++ programs.  This
 includes an optimized thread-caching malloc() and cpu and heap profiling
 utilities.  The devel package contains static and debug libraries and header
 files for developing applications that use the google-perftools package.

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: efficient thread-caching malloc
 The gperftools, previously called google-perftools, package contains some
 utilities to improve and analyze the performance of C++ programs. This is a
 part of that package, and includes an optimized thread-caching malloc.

Description: efficient thread-caching malloc
 Contains debugging symbols for libtcmalloc-minimal4.
 .
 This package is provided primarily to provide a backtrace with names
 in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier to interpret core
 dumps.  Most people will not need this package.
