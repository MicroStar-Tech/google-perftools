Depends: ${misc:Depends}, libgoogle-perftools0 (= ${binary:Version}), libtcmalloc-minimal0 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: libraries for CPU and heap analysis, plus an efficient thread-caching malloc
 The google-perftools package contains some utilities to improve and
 analyze the performance of C++ programs.  This includes an optimized
 thread-caching malloc() and cpu and heap profiling utilities.  The
 devel package contains static and debug libraries and header files
 for developing applications that use the google-perftools package.

 This package is provided primarily to provide a backtrace with names
 in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier to interpret core
 dumps.  Most people will not need this package.
